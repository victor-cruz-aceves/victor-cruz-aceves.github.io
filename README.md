1. write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html)?
1. read and implement [this](https://github.com/dr-cruz/website-miscellaneous/commit/9e9ce8e59897307f18e9900b629ec025cd31850e)
