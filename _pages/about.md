Hi, I'm Victor, research associate at the [Center for Research on Terrorism and Radicalization](https://www.ispk.uni-kiel.de/en/departments/center-for-research-on-terrorism-and-radicalization) at the [Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University (ISPK)](https://www.ispk.uni-kiel.de/en). I am currently working as **data scientist** for the projects [ERAME](https://www.ispk.uni-kiel.de/de/abteilungen/abteilung-terrorismus-und-radikalisierungsforschung/publikationen/download/projektumriss_erame.pdf) and [ERAME-Rex](https://www.ispk.uni-kiel.de/de/abteilungen/abteilung-terrorismus-und-radikalisierungsforschung/publikationen/download/projektumriss_erame-rex.pdf), which are **funded by Germany's** [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/home/home_node.html) **(BMBF)** to develop software solutions that use (among other things) **machine learning** and [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) **(NLP)** to identify a) **islamic** and b) **extreme-right radicalization** on **YouTube** and **Telegram**.

Previously, I worked as research associate and taught courses in the political science department (for 8 years) and in the sociology department (1 year) at the [Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t zu Kiel (Germany)](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/), from where I obtained my **PhD in 2018**.
